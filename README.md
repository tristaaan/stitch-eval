# Comparison of Image Stitching Methods

Comparison and evaluation tool for a variety of image stitching methods. These methods include:

- Area/spatial based
- Frequency based
- Feature based
- Learning based

## Cloning

This repository contains a submodule for the [Ã–fverstedt method repository](https://github.com/MIDA-group/py_alpha_amd_release). If you would like to pull the code for it when pulling this repo use:

```
